# Global vs Country-wise Healthcare Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that compares global and country-wise healthcare metrics across various indicators such as health expenditure, hospital admissions, and more. It helps stakeholders identify trends, disparities, and areas of concern within the global healthcare ecosystem.

## Project Objective

The goal is to build a data-driven, interactive storytelling platform that:

- Provides a comparative analysis of healthcare performance globally and at the country level
- Highlights insights and disparities using impactful visualizations
- Enables policy makers and analysts to make informed decisions based on visualized data

## Tools & Technologies

- Power BI: Used to create interactive and dynamic dashboards
- Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, transformation, and pre-processing
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For calculated columns and measures

## Dataset Overview

The project uses two datasets:
1. Global Health Expenditure Data: Tracks public and private spending on health
2. Country-wise Hospital Admissions Data: Captures hospitalization trends and healthcare utilization

## Key Features

- Global vs country-wise comparisons
- Time series analysis of healthcare spending
- Hospital admissions heatmaps and trends
- KPI cards highlighting top-performing and underperforming countries
- Filterable by year, region, and healthcare indicators

## Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard is divided into four main pages, each with specific insights:

1. Overview Dashboard – High-level KPIs, interactive map, global trends
2. Country Deep Dive – Drill down by region or specific country
3. Expenditure Analysis – Focused view on healthcare spend patterns
4. Admissions Insights – Hospitalization data visualized for comparison

## Insights & Outcomes

- Identified countries with highest vs. lowest healthcare expenditure
- Visualized correlation between spending and hospitalization rates
- Detected time-based patterns showing increase in public health investment
- Helped inform decisions related to healthcare policy and budget allocation
